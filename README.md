### Project Goals

Application was completed as a freeCodeCamp [challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/chart-the-stock-market).

1. User Story: I can view a graph displaying the recent trend lines for each added stock.

2. User Story: I can add new stocks by their symbol name.

3. User Story: I can remove stocks.

4. User Story: I can see changes in real-time when any other user adds or removes a stock. For this you will need to use Web Sockets.
